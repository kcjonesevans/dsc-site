## Step 1 – Free Trial Workout

Try out a class for free. This allows you the opportunity to experience our community and gym atmosphere firsthand to ensure it’s a good fit for you. We want you to be confident our abilities and services are what you’re looking for, and we’re sure we have a membership option to fit your needs.

## Step 2 – Starter Package Option

Once you decide DSC is a good fit for you, we recommend the Starter Package as the next step. Our Starter Package goes beyond the typical OnRamp structure in that each sessions is designed specifically for you as an individual athlete. We create these sessions to focus on the typical movements as we include in our classes, but also take into consideration your current level of fitness and exposure to these movements.

The first session of the Starter Package involves an assessment and movement screen. Your coach will use this time to evaluate your mobility and movement through a few basic screens to determine any areas that may need specific attention beyond what we would address in our classes. Your coach will be able to advise you on what they think your limitations may be, as well as provide you with some basic protocols to address those limitations.

The following sessions will then be designed to cover the movements you will most likely see in class, and structured in a way that is appropriate for your level of fitness. These sessions will progress at a pace that is comfortable for you, and we encourage questions so that you feel confident in your progress each time you’re in the gym.

## Step 3 – Join Classes
Upon completion of the starter package, you are ready to join classes. At this time, you can also choose to upgrade your class membership to “Plus” and receive 1-2 days of program design to help you reach your specific goals.
