# Program Design

At DSC, we believe that the optimal path to sustained improvement and progress towards your personal goals lies in a program that was designed with your individual needs and requirements in mind. Even the world's best group training programs can only take you so far before plateaus are reached, and something more individualized is required. Our program design option is for members who want a personalized program to follow and are familiar - trending toward proficient, or beyond - with the movements to be able to complete workouts on their own. 

If you need remote coaching - home gym athletes - we provide the program for you.  For local athletes your PD comes complimentary with <Open Gym>.

Program Design is the DSC option that offers hybridized attention to athletes who need or want their own program to follow.
