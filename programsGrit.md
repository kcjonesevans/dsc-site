# Grit

GRIT sessions will utilize challenges, tests, teamwork, penalties and rewards, uncertainty and sometimes unfairness, all with the goal of teaching the athlete to pay attention and do things the hard way. Skills and habits developed in GRIT classes will carry beyond that day's training and benefit the athlete in weekly classes and outside the four walls of the gym.
