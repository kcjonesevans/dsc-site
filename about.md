Dayton Strength & Conditioning is a gym, a community, and, a family.  We bring together our members - aka, our athletes - from all walks of life and athletic backgrounds, with one goal in mind: Mastery of the self.  Simply put: we want to be a part of your journey onto being the best version of you.

Our goal is to develop you as a human.  You're an athlete, a weekend warrior, an educator, a first-responder, a mother, or grandfather and you will find yourself at home at DSC.  Options range from Personal Training, Program Design, or Classes, plus open gym hours, and almost anything in-between; you're guaranteed to find your niche.

What happens in the gym doesn't stay in the gym.  Strength, coordination, confidence, and a host of others will be acquired within the walls of DSC but you will carry them forward and out our doors.  And we're excited and proud to be a part of that journey with you.
