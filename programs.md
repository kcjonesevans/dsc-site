# New to training?

Are you completely new to the world of strength training? Don’t know a deadlift from a squat? Or have you been out of the game for a long time and looking to ease back in? Not a problem at all! We have multiple services available to introduce you to our system smoothly and at a pace that you will be comfortable with. Schedule your assessment today!

## Your assessment includes:

Discussion on current training regimen, as well as lifestyle and nutrition habits.
Body composition testing using SSS method to gather more insight into any potential hormonal imbalances or areas of specific concern.

Physical Assessment – Used to analyze the athlete’s current physical state, as well as to uncover any strength imbalances or structural deficits that might lead to a future injury.

Functional movement/flexibility testing – Used to analyze movement patterns in each major plane, across all major joints. Can reveal red flags in the athlete’s specific flexibility that can then be addressed in the program.
Work Capacity Testing – Dependent on athlete’s current state, and goals. Simple, repeatable tests that can be done during the session or on the athlete’s own time where appropriate.
