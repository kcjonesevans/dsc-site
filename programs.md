# Strength & Conditioning

Our S&C class is the entre for many into the world of functional fitness.  It is all things functional movement.  All manner of implements may be used.  Barbells, dumbbells, kettle bells, bodyweight, gymnastics rings, sleds, medicine balls, assault bikes, rowers . . . and on goes the list.

We run periodized cycles of three to eight weeks.  We focus on strength.  We focus on conditioning.  We focus on gymnastics.  You bring the determination and mental fortitude.

The goal is to produce well-rounded athletes through strength movements like the squat or press; power movements like the clean or push jerk; conditioning through multi-modal 'circuits' of varying equipment and energy systems.

# Grit

GRIT sessions will utilize challenges, tests, teamwork, penalties and rewards, uncertainty and sometimes unfairness, all with the goal of teaching the athlete to pay attention and do things the hard way. Skills and habits developed in GRIT classes will carry beyond that day's training and benefit the athlete in weekly classes and outside the four walls of the gym.

# Program Design

At DSC, we believe that the optimal path to sustained improvement and progress towards your personal goals lies in a program that was designed with your individual needs and requirements in mind. Even the world's best group training programs can only take you so far before plateaus are reached, and something more individualized is required. Our program design option is for members who want a personalized program to follow and are familiar - trending toward proficient, or beyond - with the movements to be able to complete workouts on their own. 

If you need remote coaching - home gym athletes - we provide the program for you.  For local athletes your PD comes complimentary with <Open Gym>.

Program Design is the DSC option that offers hybridized attention to athletes who need or want their own program to follow.

Program Design is a potent dose of instruction and movement.  For athletes that require more we recommend that regular Personal Training Sessions are included to provide greater depth and breadth in movements and modalities.

# Personal Training

Our passion as coaches and trainers comes in working with clients on a personal level to help them achieve their fitness goals.  Personal Training is a great option for beginner athletes to train one-on-one with us and learn correct movement and intensity, as well as for intermediate and advanced athletes who may want another set of eyes on them to correct form or need an extra push in the intensity of their workouts.

What is included?
"	One-on-one or one-on-two 60 min sessions with a trainer, at whatever frequency works best for your goals and schedule. Your coach will take you through the entire session from warm-up to workout to cool down, ensuring proper form is being used throughout and that the dose response of the workout is appropriate for you at that time.

# Open Gym

DSC is the only gym of its kind that offers open gym.  Full stop.  We hope that you find value in our classes, Program Design, or Personal Training.  That said we understand and welcome athletes who simply need a place to get their own workout in, or perform their day's programming from another coach.  If this is you then our Open Gym membership is for you.  Fro more details please <contact us>.
