Housed in Beavercreek's McAfee Sports Center, our facility has 5000sq ft of workout space, high quality equipment and restrooms equipped with showers. We are a stone's throw away from the famous <Creekside Trail>, Dayton's premier bike path with access to Dayton and Xenia, providing a great option for our client's running workouts. Our building is just minutes off of Rt. 35 with easy access to 675.

Our gym is outfitted with enough equipment to handle any individual or team workout imaginable, but we also possess enough space for clients to spread out and perform a variety of bodyweight/barbell movements without feeling crowded in. Our equipment consists of everything from good old fashioned strength and conditioning tools (barbells, dumbbells, kettlebells, pull-up bars, plyo boxes, medicine balls, and jump ropes) to state of the art specialty equipment for someone with more focus (lifting platforms, jerk blocks, pulling blocks, GHDs, reverse hyper, rowing machines, airdynes, specialty barbells, climbing ropes, gymnastics rings, and strongman equipment).

We have everything necessary to provide clients of all ages, sizes, and ability level a workout appropriate for their needs and goals.
