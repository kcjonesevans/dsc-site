# Personal Training

Our passion as coaches and trainers comes in working with clients on a personal level to help them achieve their fitness goals.  Personal Training is a great option for beginner athletes to train one-on-one with us and learn correct movement and intensity, as well as for intermediate and advanced athletes who may want another set of eyes on them to correct form or need an extra push in the intensity of their workouts.

What is included?
"	One-on-one or one-on-two 60 min sessions with a trainer, at whatever frequency works best for your goals and schedule. Your coach will take you through the entire session from warm-up to workout to cool down, ensuring proper form is being used throughout and that the dose response of the workout is appropriate for you at that time.
