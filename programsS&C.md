Our S&C class is the entre for many into the world of functional fitness.  It is all things functional movement.  All manner of implements may be used.  Barbells, dumbbells, kettle bells, bodyweight, gymnastics rings, sleds, medicine balls, assault bikes, rowers . . . and on goes the list.

We run periodized cycles of three to eight weeks.  We focus on strength.  We focus on conditioning.  We focus on gymnastics.  You bring the determination and mental fortitude.

The goal is to produce well-rounded athletes through strength movements like the squat or press; power movements like the clean or push jerk; conditioning through multi-modal 'circuits' of varying equipment and energy systems.
