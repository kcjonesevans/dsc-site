Welcome to the family!  We mean it.  We're small group, decidedly so. Our facility, our coaches, and our members are a community and we're thankful you've joined.

We check our egos at the door.  We come in.  We do work.  We revel in the shared experience.  And we live our lives.  You're goals are our goals.

So <<Contact Us>> and let us know what you want.  What you need.  Spare no detail and expect the same from us.  Check out our <<Programs>> and let us know what you think your best option is - and if you don't know we can work that out too.

# What's Next?

Free Trial Workout
Take a free trial workout.  Any class.  Any day. Any time.  <<Contact us>> and let us know when' you'll be in so we can sort out any prelims/admin.  Or don't - we can do most of it when you walk enter.

# Start Package (aka On-ramp)
Once you decide DSC is a good fit for you, we recommend the Starter Package as the next step. Our Starter Package goes beyond the typical On-ramp structure. These sessions to focus on the typical movements as we include in our classes, but also take into consideration your current level of fitness and exposure to these movements.

The first session of the Starter Package involves an assessment and movement screen. Your coach will use this time to assess your:
-	Ranges of motion; 
-	Strengths and limitations; 
-	Imbalances;
-	Central nervous system adaptation;
-	Others, as needed.

Your coach will be able to advise you on what they think your limitations may be, as well as provide you with some basic protocols to address those limitations.

The following sessions cover the movements you will most likely see in class, and structured in a way that is appropriate for your level of fitness. These sessions will progress at a pace that is comfortable for you, and we encourage questions so that you feel confident in your progress each time you're in the gym.
